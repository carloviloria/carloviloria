## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Carlo, and I am a recent graduate at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa with a Bachelors in Computer Science (BS).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making new projects as someone looking to get into the computer industry!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning CSS, HTML, React, Javascript, C#, vibe coding, anything that I currently find interesting.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a huge volleyball nerd, hardcore video game fan, and a music lover (mainly pop).
